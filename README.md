See the keyboard centered on the page  
Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors  
White keys will change to yellow #ffd200  
Black keys will change to pink #f40082  
When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.  
The audio clips are numbered, but the keys are not specifically numbered. You can pick which key should be associated with each audio file.  
If a user clicks on one key, then immediately clicks on a second key. The 2 files should both play. Meaning, clicking on one key will not stop an existing audio file from playing.
